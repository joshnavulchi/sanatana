## Build notes

- Baseline browser mapping warning:
	- If you see the message:
		```
		[baseline-browser-mapping] The data in this module is over two months old.  To ensure accurate Baseline data, please update: `npm i baseline-browser-mapping@latest -D`
		```
		run the following to update the dev dependency locally (safe and recommended):
		```powershell
		npm i baseline-browser-mapping@latest -D
		npm run build
		```

- Static export vs server build (`NEXT_STATIC_EXPORT`):
	- This repository can be built either as a server-capable Next app (API routes and middleware available) or as a static export (HTML-only) used for static hosts. The build mode is controlled by the environment variable `NEXT_STATIC_EXPORT`.
	- When `NEXT_STATIC_EXPORT=true` the build sets `output: 'export'` which disables API routes and middleware. If you rely on API routes (for analytics/cookies) or middleware, do NOT set `NEXT_STATIC_EXPORT=true`.
	- To build as a server-capable app (default), ensure the env var is not set or set it to `false` before running `npm run build`:
		```powershell
		Remove-Item Env:NEXT_STATIC_EXPORT
		npm run build
		```
	- In CI, avoid setting `NEXT_STATIC_EXPORT=true` unless you intentionally want a static-only export. If using static export in CI for a static host, document this choice in your pipeline config so other maintainers are aware.

If you'd like, I can also pin an updated `baseline-browser-mapping` version in `package.json` for you to `npm install` locally. Let me know if you want me to do that.

## Locale Data

Locale/translation JSON files are stored in the `locales/` folder (e.g. `locales/en/`, `locales/hi/`, etc.) and are read directly at build time via dynamic imports. No API route or remote download step is needed.

## Dynamic JSON Content

This project also serves structured content (pages, lists, items) as JSON under `public/data/locales/{locale}/...`. To support dynamic, nested routes we use runtime `fetch` to load those JSON files on the server (App Router pages) rather than importing JSON at build time.

Key points:

- **Helpers:** `lib/getContentPath.ts` builds the public URL for a given locale and segment array. `lib/fetchContent.ts` performs the runtime `fetch` and implements a simple fallback (try `{segments}.json` then `{segments}/index.json`).
- **Do NOT import JSON files directly.** Always fetch at runtime using the Fetch API so the same code works in dev, build, and static export modes.
- **Server fetch pattern (used in page.tsx):**

	- Build segments, e.g. `['vedas','atharvaveda','book1','hymn']` → use `getContentPath(locale, segments)`
	- `const res = await fetch(path, { cache: 'force-cache' })`
	- If `res.ok` parse JSON and render; else try folder `index.json`; if still missing call `notFound()`.

- **Routes:** use a catch-all route (`app/<section>/[...segments]/page.tsx`) to handle arbitrary depths. `params.segments` is an array of the path components (e.g. `['atharvaveda','book1','hymn']`).
- **Locale handling:** detect server locale via `detectServerLocaleFromHeaders(headers())` for server pages. Client components should use `useLocale()` to access the active locale when needed, but do not rely on it for server content fetches.
- **Fallback UI:** use `useLocaleSection()` only for UI fallback strings (labels, headings), not for main content data.
- **Safe rendering:** always use optional chaining and fallbacks (e.g. `data?.title ?? 'Untitled'`) and avoid assumptions about structure to prevent runtime crashes.
- **Performance:** use `fetch(..., { cache: 'force-cache' })` to let Next/edge/runtime cache responses; the `fetchContent` helper already uses this.

Example content path:

```
/data/locales/en/vedas/atharvaveda/book1/hymn.json
```

If you want directory listing behavior, add an `index.json` inside the folder (e.g. `/data/locales/en/vedas/atharvaveda/book1/index.json`) containing an `items` array.

Files added/modified for this feature:

- `lib/getContentPath.ts` — builds content URL
- `lib/fetchContent.ts` — runtime fetch + index fallback
- `app/vedas/page.tsx` and `app/vedas/[...segments]/page.tsx` — example implementation
- similar catch-all pages added for: `vedic-philosophy`, `puranas`, `upanishads`, `itihasa`

Troubleshooting:

- If pages return 404, confirm a matching JSON exists under `public/data/locales/{locale}/...` or add an `index.json` for folders.
- For locale mismatches, ensure cookies or request headers include `sanatana_dharma_language` or that `detectServerLocaleFromHeaders` can resolve the expected locale.


## Critical CSS — Home

This project includes a small critical CSS flow to inline only the most important styles for the Home page to reduce render-blocking requests and lower CLS.

- Generated file: `public/critical-home.css` (inlined by `app/page.tsx` when present).
- Generation script: `npm run generate:critical:home` (also run automatically during `prebuild`).
- Preferred workflow: install the `tailwindcss` CLI in your environment (dev dependency) so the generator produces a Tailwind-derived critical stylesheet. Example:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npm run generate:critical:home
```

- Fallback: if `tailwindcss` CLI is unavailable the generator writes a small handcrafted fallback CSS so builds remain deterministic. To get full Tailwind output ensure the CLI is installed in CI.
- Size guidance: keep the inlined critical CSS under ~5–8 KB. The generator will warn if the output exceeds 8 KB.
- Content guidance:
	- Inline only critical Home page styles (hero, layout, basic typography, grid).
	- Inline dimensions for key images/containers to prevent CLS.
	- Inline background + layout, but avoid inline animations.

CI / Render notes:
- Ensure `tailwindcss` is available in your CI image (install devDependencies) or run the generator in a step that has the CLI installed.
- Cache `public/critical-home.css` or re-run the generator during builds — regenerating is cheap if `tailwindcss` is present.

If you want, I can add a short CI snippet for Render/GitHub Actions to install `tailwindcss` and cache `public/critical-home.css` and `node_modules`.

## Render scheduled deploy

This repository includes a Render configuration (`render.yaml`) that defines a cron job `weekly-deploy` which triggers a deploy webhook every Sunday at 08:00 IST (02:30 UTC).

Setup steps on Render:

- Create a Deploy Hook for your `sanatanadharmam.in` service in the Render dashboard (Settings → Deploy Hooks) and copy the hook URL.
- In your Render service environment variables, add `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK` with the Deploy Hook URL.
- Ensure `render.yaml` is deployed to the service (it is included in this repo). Render will run the cron job and POST the hook URL at the scheduled time.

If you prefer, I can instead configure the scheduled deploy using Render's UI; the `render.yaml` approach stores the schedule as code in the repo.

1. Quick commands

	 - List changes:

		 ```bash
		 openspec list --json
		 ```

	 - Create a new change (proposal):

		 ```bash
		 openspec new change "<name>"
		 ```

	 - Check change status:

		 ```bash
		 openspec status --change "<name>" --json
		 ```

	 - Get apply instructions for implementation:

		 ```bash
		 openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
		 ```

	 - Archive a completed change:

		 ```bash
		 openspec archive --change "<name>"
		 ```

2. Propose (artifact creation) guidance

	 - Use `/opsx:propose <name>` or run `openspec new change` to scaffold a change under `openspec/changes/<name>/`.
	 - Fill `proposal.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` according to the schema. Keep proposals concise and include a "Non-goals" section.
	 - For UI or page changes, include localization and testing implications (see Locale checklist below).

3. Implement (apply) guidance

	 - Run `openspec instructions apply` to obtain the current tasks and context files. Read the listed context files before implementing.
	 - Implement tasks in small increments; every completed task should update the `tasks.md` checklist (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`).
	 - Keep changes minimal and focused to the task. Prefer updating existing `lib/` utilities and `app/hooks/` over adding new helpers.
	 - After completing code changes for a task, run:

		 ```bash
		 npm run check
		 ```

		 This runs lint, format, and tests. Fix issues before marking a task done.

4. Archive guidance

	 - Before archiving, ensure artifacts are complete and tasks are done. If there are delta specs, decide whether to sync them to `openspec/specs/`.
	 - Archive moves the change directory into `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>`.

5. Locale checklist (for new pages or UI text)

	 - Follow the `about` page pattern for new pages:
		 - Add `app/<route>/page.tsx` which imports a client component and uses `createGenerateMetadata('<route>')`.
		 - Client component should use `useLocaleSection('<route>')` or `useLocale()` and render content from the locale namespace.
		 - Add locale JSON files at `public/locales/<locale>/<route>.json` for each supported locale. Example structure:

			 ```json
			 {
				 "<route>": {
					 "title": "Page title",
					 "description": "Short description for meta",
					 "sections": [
						 { "id": "s1", "title": "Section 1", "text": "Text for section 1", "bullets": ["a","b"] }
					 ],
					 "disclaimer": "Optional disclaimer text"
				 }
			 }
			 ```

	 - Ensure no user-facing strings are hardcoded in components — reference locale keys instead.
	 - If adding new locales or keys, update `openspec/config.yaml` rules or mention translation work in the proposal.

6. Repository conventions (summary)

	 - Tech stack: Next.js, TypeScript (strict), React, Tailwind CSS.
	 - Prefer `app/components`, `app/hooks`, and `lib/` utilities.
	 - Do not import Node `fs`/`path` directly; use repository utilities.
	 - Run `npm run check` before committing.

7. Example workflow (create and implement a new page)

	 - Create change: `openspec new change add-example-page`
	 - Populate `proposal.md` with scope, non-goals, and localization plan.
	 - Populate `design.md` describing files to add (`app/example/page.tsx`, `app/example/exampleclient.tsx`, `public/locales/en/example.json`).
	 - Add `tasks.md` with small tasks (max ~2 hours each), e.g., "Add page scaffold", "Add locale file (en)", "Add tests".
	 - Run `/opsx:apply add-example-page` or `openspec instructions apply --change "add-example-page" --json` and implement tasks.
	 - Run `npm run check` and mark tasks done. When all done, archive the change.

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm run audit:seo
    # or run the postbuild directly
    npm run postbuild

If you'd like, I can also add a small template generator that creates the page scaffold and starter locale JSON when you create a new proposal. Ask me to scaffold `openspec/changes/<name>/artifacts` for a new page and I'll generate starter files.

## Sync locales script

Use the `scripts/sync-locales.js` helper to (re)generate per-locale `index.ts` files for JSON namespaces under `public/data/locales`.

- Basic (regenerates indexes for all non-source locales):

```powershell
node .\scripts\sync-locales.js
```

- Include the source locale (`en`) as well:

```powershell
$env:INCLUDE_SOURCE = '1'; node .\scripts\sync-locales.js
```

- Or use the CLI flag:

```powershell
node .\scripts\sync-locales.js --include-source
```

- Notes: the script writes `index.ts` files that import and merge JSON files in each locale folder. By default the source locale (`en`) is skipped to avoid overwriting canonical source indexes; pass `--include-source` or set `INCLUDE_SOURCE=1` to regenerate `en` indexes as well.
